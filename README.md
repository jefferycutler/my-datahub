### Jeff's personal project to learn new Data gather and ETL tools

I work in data engineering and data analytics.  This business is always in a state of change.  As we move from databases to datalake technologies like Hadoop to newer technologies like Kafka and Kuberneties I need to keep up.  My home lab is centered on this Github repo.

## Folders in this project

**ansible**

Ansible is a handy tool for deploying and maintaining assets.  I am trying to learn more about Ansible automation.  Check this folder for my ansible scripts.  Some things I have built so far are: building a Raspberry Pi k3s cluster, Setting up a syslog relay to Kafka, loadbalancers for the k3s cluster, and more.

**k8s** 
This will be primarily focused on helm charts for kuberneties deployment.  Not much there right now but more is coming.

**gcp**
Not everything will be in my home computer lab.  Some of it will be in GCP and that means cloud build and terraform.
